You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log.
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be
smaller than or equal to N.
You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

```java
public class order
{
    int orderId;

    public order(int orderId)
    {
        this.orderId = orderId;
    }


}
public class log
{
    int N;
    int length;
    order[] orders;

    public log(int N)
    {
        this.N = N;
        length = 0;
        orders = new order[N];
    }

    public int size()
    {
        return length;
    }

    pubilc boolean record(int id)
    {
        if(length < N - 1)
        {
            order newOrder = new order(id);
            length++;
            orders[length] = newOrder
        } else return false;
    }

    public order getLast(int i)
    {
        if(i < N) return orders[i-1];
        else return null;
    }
}
```

> another idea is to use a [`circular buffer`](http://www.programming-algorithms.net/article/40698/Circular-buffer), which has O(1) for getFirst and addLast, but still O(n) in getIth.
