A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different
colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring
houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to
build the nthhouse with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this
goal.

```java
public class PaintHouseTwo {
    public int minCostII(int[][] costs) {
        if (costs != null && costs.length == 0) return 0;
 
        int preMin = 0, preSecndMin = 0, preColor = -1;
 
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; i++) {
            int curMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int curSecndMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int curColor = -1;
            for (int j = 0; j < costs[0].length; j++) {
                costs[i][j] = costs[i][j] + (preColor == j ? preSecndMin : preMin);
 
                if (costs[i][j] < curMin) {
                    curSecndMin = curMin;
                    curMin = costs[i][j];
                    curColor = j;
                } else if (costs[i][j] < curSecndMin) {
                    curSecndMin = costs[i][j];
                }
            }
            preMin = curMin;
            preSecndMin = curSecndMin;
            preColor = curColor;
        }
        return preMin;
    }
}
```
