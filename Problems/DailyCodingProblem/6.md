An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

```
Property: If A XOR B = C then, A XOR C = B as well as, B XOR C = A
Example: 
Consider a list as follows:

A -> B -> C -> D

Here, address variable (let's call it x_ptr) of each node will contain following information:

Node A: x_ptr = NULL XOR address(B)

Node B: x_ptr = address(A) XOR address(C)

Node C: x_ptr = address(B) XOR address(D)

Node D: x_ptr = address(C) XOR NULL

We can traverse this linked list in both forward and reverse directions. To get the next node we will require the address of previous node.

Example: Operations to traverse from A to D (We have Node A) are as follows :

B = NULL XOR A->x_ptr

C = A XOR B->x_ptr

D = B XOR C->x_ptr

Similarly, List can be traversed in backward direction.

    int both = -1; 
    int data;

    public Node(int data)
    {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public int getData() return data;

    public void setBoth(Node prev, Node next)
    {
        this.both = prev.getPointer() ^ next.getPointer();
    }

    public int getBoth() return both;
}

public void LinkedList()

    public LinkedList()

        } else if (head.equals(tail)) {
            head.setBoth(null, node);
            tail = node;
        } else {
            tail.setBoth(head, node);
            tail = node;
        }
    }

    public Node get(int index)
    {
        Node prev = null;
        Node current = head;
        Node next = null;

        while(index > 0)
        {
            int nextAddress = current.getBoth() ^ prev.getBoth();
            next = dereference_pointer(nextAddress);
            
            prev = current;
            current = next;
            index--;
        }

        return current;
